No, really.","\n","^You don't even need to be asked to come outside, and soon you're already standing in the shadows of giant statues of bananas. They look so real that it's confusing. You can see the creases on these artificial fruits as if they've been tossed around. They're a pale greenish yellow, like <i>actual</i> bananas.","\n","^Your party is confused. They've never seen bananas before - or been told about them - let alone <i>giant</i> ones.","\n","^There's a man standing in a broken section of the highway railing, holding a book. He's wearing a beret, with no hairline to support it, and impossibly striped clothing. He turns towards you upon hearing footsteps, while spinning on his heel. His broken monocle nearly slides off his nose, and it's clearly a size too big for him.","\n","^His moustache is incredible, though. How does he manage?","\n","^\"Ahhh, welcome! To the Moo-sa Acu-mee-natah exhibit!\" The man speaks with fake grandeur. You don't even know what he's saying, but he's saying it confidently, so what does it matter?","\n","^Before you can even get a word in, he starts to speak, gesturing wildly towards the bananas. Words enter one ear and out the other.","\n","^\"- You see, the Moo-sa Acu-mee-natah used to be fruits our ancestors consoomed on the daily! Yes, yes of course!
