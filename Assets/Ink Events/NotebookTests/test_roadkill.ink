-> roadkill

== roadkill ==
A dead snake lies on the side of the road. Its half-shed skin shines in the thin yellow grass. Someone definitely dumped it there after running over it. Who'd have thought that there's empathy even for snakes?

* [ Approach ] -> approach
* [ Leave ] -> leave

== leave ==
-> END

== approach ==
What the kind(?) stranger hadn't noticed however is that the snake had something sticking from its throat. It looks papery. You could probably get it out, but what if it's venomous?

* [ Take Out Paper ] -> paper
* [ Don't ] -> nopaper

== nopaper ==
Ew. You don't feel like sticking your fingers down the dead snake's mouth, obviously. What ever is in there is not for you to pick at.

-> END

== paper ==
You carefully take the piece of paper out, and it's surprisingly long, and even dry. The snake has been dead for a while, and it's gone cold.

The paper is actually a folded and rolled up flyer for a game of "Grenade Football" and underneath "BBY MODE: ITS PINNED." It seems to be an old invitation.

...Do these people not have a regular football? //maybe we can skin the snake??

-> END
